# Getting Started with examples

This section gives instructions to configure OSC message sending/receiving through basic examples:

- [Controlling a GameObject from a remote OSC app](example-osc-input.md)

- [Controlling a remote OSC app from Unity](example-osc-output.md)

**Note:** To enable functional sending and receiving of OSC messages from the Unity Editor, you need to have an OSC compatible application or device connected to the same network as your Unity workstation.
