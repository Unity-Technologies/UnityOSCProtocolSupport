# About OSC

>[!NOTE]
>To use the OSC package, you must install it separately. For detailed information about package requirements and installation instructions, refer to [Installation](installation.md).

Send and receive control messages between the Unity Editor and external devices using the Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol.

## Concept and use cases

The [Open Sound Control (OSC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control) protocol is a message format used to share simple parameters between devices and/or applications, typically via UDP over the network or via other transport protocols or media.

OSC is often encountered in virtual production or audio workstation environments.

In Unity, the OSC package allows you, for example, to:

-   Control GameObjects of your Unity Scene using touch pads, sliders and buttons from a remote OSC app.

-   Automatically update display elements of a remote OSC app when something changes in your Unity Scene.
