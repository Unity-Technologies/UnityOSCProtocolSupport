# OSC

Use the OSC package to send and receive Open Sound Control (OSC) format messages from Unity. This package implements full support for the [OSC 1.0](https://opensoundcontrol.stanford.edu/spec-1_0.html) specification, and much of the [OSC 1.1](https://opensoundcontrol.stanford.edu/files/2009-NIME-OSC-1.1.pdf) specification.

## Installation and use

To get instructions about installing and using the OSC package in the Unity Editor, download the [`Built-documentation.zip`](Built-documentation.zip) file available in this folder, unzip it locally, and open the `index.html` file.

>**Note:** The `Documentation~` folder includes the documentation sources in Markdown.
